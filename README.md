# Compiler-Construction
It is a compiler, completely written in C, for a toy language. This project was done as part of coursework of Compiler Construction course at BITS Pilani. The langugage (referred to as ERPLAG henceforth) specifications can be found at [Language Specifications](Language%20specifications.pdf).
The input given is the program written in ERPLAG. The compiler's output is 32-bit assembly code. This assembly code is converted to machine code using NASM.

## Motivation [[Index](#index)]
The aim of the project is to
* understand the various stages of compilation in details
* implement every stage from scratch using C
* understand how code generation and optimization takes place

Note that after cloning the repository, you'll need to make certain changes to this directory structure (refer to step (1) in [How to run](#how-to-run)) for more details. The directory strcuture has been deliberately kept different for more wholesome understanding of the project structure.

## Understanding directory structure [[Index](#index)]
* The grammar given in [Language Specifications](Language%20specifications.pdf) isn't LL(1). It has been made LL(1) and written in [grammar.txt](grammar.txt) file.
* [AST Rules](Group%2033%20-%20Compiler%20AST%20rules.pdf) contains all the AST rules that have been used for AST creation. It also contains all the updated grammar rules.
* The names of the files in `src` and `headers` folder are self explanatory and each name represents a particular part of the compiler being implemented. Thus, the implementation has been divided into following parts:
  * **Stage 1 (Syntax analysis):**
    * Lexical Analysis (`lexer.h`, `lexerDef.h`, `lexer.c`)
    * Parsing (`parser.h`, `parserDef.h`, `parser.c`)
  * **Stage 2 (Semantic analysis and nasm code generation):**
    * AST creation (`ast.h`, `astDef.h`, `ast.c`)
    * Symbol table creation (`symbolTable.h`, `symbolTableDef.h`, `symbolTable.c`)
    * Semantic analysis (`semantics.h`, `semanticsDef.h`, `semantics.c`)
    * Intermediate code generation (`codegen.h`, `codegenDef.h`, `codegen.c`)
    * NASM code generation (`nasm.h`, `nasmDef.h`, `nasm.c`)
* `testFiles` folder conatins many test programs written in ERPLAG that can be used to test the compiler for code generation, symbol table creation, syntax and semantic error detection, etc.
* `sampleOutputs` folder contains sample symbol table and AST that is created by the compiler.
* Refer to the [Coding Details - 1](Coding%20Intricacies%20and%20Details.pdf) and [Coding Details - 2](Coding_Details_Stage1.pdf) files for understanding how each part of compiler has been implemented.

## Tech used [[Index](#index)]
* Code is completely written in C
* `gcc` and `multilib` library of `gcc` must be installed

## Dev Setup [[Index](#index)]
Install gcc, gcc-multilib and g++-multilib using:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install gcc gcc-multilib g++-multilib
```

## How to run [[Index](#index)]
**1.** Clone the repository. **Before moving onto the next step, please ensure that all files in `headers` and `src` folders are present in one single folder (i.e. at same hierarchy). `makefile` and `grammar.txt` should also be present in the same folder.**

**2.** Copy the program that you want to compile (the one that would be written in ERPLAG) into the folder created in step (1). 

**3.** Run the makefile (as `make`) to generate the `compiler` executable. `compiler` can henceforth be used as we use `gcc` in Linux i.e. it's now the compiler for any program written in ERPLAG.

**4.** Now compile your test program using: 
```bash
./compiler <Name_of_the_program_file> code.asm
```
Note that `code.asm` is the name of the file that would containt the assembly code that is generated by the compiler. This name can be anything but ensure that it's an asm file.

**5.** Now run the following commands in sequence to generate the executable from the `code.asm` file generated in step (3):
```bash
nasm -f elf -F dwarf -g code.asm
gcc -m32 code.o -o code
./code
```
